In December 2019, the Corona pandemic began sweeping the world, and there was a need
for a vaccine that works to reduce the symptoms of infection and reduce hospitalizations and
deaths. In this project we provide a dataset containing tweets with Jordanian opinions about
Covid-19 vaccines, and we classify these tweets, which is supervised learning classification task
using pre-trained model into five classes to determine whether the tweet sentiment is (very
positive, positive, mixed-neutral, negative, very negative). The model trained and tested using
dataset with Arabic tweets from Kaggle platform, then fine-tuned to get 83% accuracy, and
then the model predicted the collected dataset classes.
We found that the total vaccinations in Jordan is increasing over time starting from 2021 to
this moment the numbers keep updating. The Jordanian Twitter sentiments is almost negative
with 50% of the tweets were classified into very negative, and 18% of the tweets were classified
into very positive. Most of the tweets are concentrated in the period from March 2021 until this
moment, and it could be expected that the percentage of vaccinations will continue to increase
in the coming period.
